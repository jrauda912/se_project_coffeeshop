# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- The text within `menu__subtitle` isn't completely accurate with the brief, with the line break occuring too early. Line height might need adjusting.

- The background image used in `menu` appears too large in comparison to the brief, despite following brief specifications. Could change the the `background-size` to a different value.

- Changing the checkbox used in `form__label_type_checkbox` from the default checkbox to a custom checkbox would be a great addition! A small change to the aesthetic could easily make the checkbox fit in more with the design of the website. Need to add this as soon as time allows.

- Adding more resources for coffee brewing should be a priority! Need to also add simple descriptions below each `recipe__video-caption` that highlights the steps to brew according to their designated technique, for ease of access for site visitors.
